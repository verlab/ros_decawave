   (b)	The Decawave DRTLS Manager which is an Android™ application for configuration of DRTLS nodes (nodes based on the Module) over Bluetooth™.

   (c)	The Decawave DRTLS Gateway Application which supplies a gateway function (on a Raspberry Pi ®) routing DRTLS location and sensor data traffic onto an IP based network (e.g. LAN), and consists of the following components:
      •	DRTLS Gateway Linux Kernel Module
      •	DRTLS Gateway Daemon
      •	DRTLS Gateway MQTT Broker
      •	DRTLS Gateway Web Manager 

   (d)	Example Host API functions, also designed to run on a Raspberry Pi, which show how to drive the Module from an external host microprocessor.
